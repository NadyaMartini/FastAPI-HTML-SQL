# FastAPI-HTML-SQL
A simple "greeting app" demonstrating the connection between HTML pages, an SQL database, and FastAPI. 
The app allows users to input their name on one page, validates the input to ensure it is a valid name, stores the data in an SQL database, and displays a personalized greeting on another page.
